- tx_pos is a pig. struct texts are in principle immutable objects, except that
  lists of positions are attached to it. These lists (and that is the root of
  the problem )are accessed from two points, one in pass2 to fill in NL
  positions and in pass3 to report them. This makes it impossible to write
  const struct text in most places. Maybe there should be a superstruct
  struct super_text {
  	 const struct *st_text;
	 struct position *st_pos;
  }
  Not elegant either.

- some size_t are sizes, others are positions, indexes

- start,limit -> start,length

- Bool.h

- report runs as '... <matching text only> ...' (proper name for Retrieve_Runs())

- unify idf2token() in *lang.l

- get rid of static forward references to routines; occurrences:
      	     	    	    egr static *.c | grep "("
      1 compare.c
      7 hash.c
      2 pass1.c
      4 pass2.c
     12 pass3.c
      1 stream.c
      3 text.c

- lex_nl_cnt counts from 1; this requires small, complicating adjustments

Done ================================================================

+ command line parameter consistency

+ make sim_text case-indifferent?

+ sortlist.bdy by split-merge

+ get rid of the nl_buff mechanism. No, use 16 bits line length.

+ in hash.c, size_t -> uint64_t? No, unit32_t is just as good.

+ / misinterpreted by shell; | alternative

+ register - removed

+ Run hashing OK: average chain length = 1.5, for sim-ing the sources of MCD2
+ Idf hashing OK: smooth distribution when sim-ing the sources of MCD2

+ use two-byte tokens to obtain better resolution for sim_text and on -F option
  and UTF-8 (Johnson, Benjamin (US - Chicago))

+ different defaults per program

+ cleaning up sim.c & names

+ Microsoft comment (// ... unescaped \n)

+ emails 2009-2011 (A = I answered, R= they replied)
+AR	Marcus Brinkmann, separate letters
+AR	Scott Kuhl, percentages
+AR	Yaroslav Halchenko, identifying non-existent lines
+A	Rumen Stefanov, UTF-8
+A	Jonathan Martin, UTF-8
+AR	UTF-8 (Johnson, Benjamin (US - Chicago))

+ better structure between X.h and X.c

+ clean-up language.h and its sub-class algollike.h

+ warning in README to correct for non-MSDOS

Rejected ================================================================

X db_ not protected by #ifdef but by compilation to a call to an (empty) routine
  1. not conspicuous enough in the code; 2. impairs efficiency
